# Data Feminism

All data are local
All systems are political

## things to discuss
- > the question is not ‘How do we make automated systems fairer?’ but rather to think about how we got here. How might we recov4er that ability to collectively self determine?” This is why bias (in individuals, in data sets, or in algorithms) is not a strong enough concept in which to anchor ideas about equity and justice.

- > following feminist theorist Elizabeth Grosz, what is regarded as "excess" in
any given system might possibly be the most interesting thing to explore because
it tells us the most about what and who the system is trying to exclude.
In the case of data visualization, this excess is emotion and affect, embodiment
and expression, embellishment and decoration. These are the aspects of human
experience coded "female," and thus devalued by the logic of our master stereotype.
But how might we intentionally flip this? 

- > And they can break when that object or person
shouldn’t even be placed in a category to begin with. In each of these cases, it’s
important to ask whether it’s the categories that are broken, or whether-- and
this is a key feminist move-- it’s the system of classification itself. Whether it’s
the gender binary, or the patriarchy, or-- to get a little heady-- the distinction
between nature and culture, or reason and emotion, or public and private, or
body and world, decades of feminist thinking would tell us to question why these
distinctions might have come about; what social, cultural, or political values
they reflect; and, crucially, whether they should exist in the first place.

- Data sets vs data settings
    - > Scholars Katie Rawson and Trevor Muñoz have advanced the idea that “the cleaning paradigm assumes an underlying, ‘correct’ order,” and warn that cleaning can be a “diversity-hiding trick.” In the perceived “messiness” of data there is actually rich information about the circumstances under which it was collected.

- > or example, demographer Jill Williams suggests that quantitative work informed by feminist theory may need to treat gender as a dependent variable. Meaning, this work would look at gender as an outcome of other intersecting aspects of identity such as age, race, class, sexuality and ethnicity. Doing that kind of intersectional analysis might lead you to discover the connection between millennials and expanded social networks that you had previously missed. A related but slightly more technical proposal

- > the single most damaging thing one can do to uphold the racist, sexist order of the world is to claim that they have no values, no politics, and that their work with data is neutral

- > The answer to these challenges is not that everyone needs more spreadsheet
training but rather that there needs to be a more effective participatory process
around how data is used in the organization

the Nobel-prize-winning research of geneticist Barbara McClintock, in order to

a combination of experiment and insight, reason and emotion. A

  - > “Education either functions as an
instrument which is used to facilitate integration of the younger generation into
the logic of the present system and bring about conformity or it becomes the
practice of freedom, the means by which men and women deal critically and
creatively with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of
their world

## values
- build relationships
    - try to change the culture into a *data culture*, not siloed into tech ppl? 

- > For this reason, it’s also important to reframe “doing good” with data as something more akin to “doing equity” or “doing co-liberation” with data to remove some of its paternalistic overtones. All too often, well meaning “help” is conceived as saving unfortunate victims from their own technological ignorance.
- > Whereas an act of data service performed by a technical organization for a community-based group is often framed as charity, an ethics of care would frame it as one step in deeper relationship building and broader demographic healing
- >The success
of a single project would not only rest on whether the database was organized
according to spec or whether the algorithm was able to classify things properly,
but also on how much trust was built between institutions and communities,
how effectively those with power and resources shared their power and resources,
how much learning happened in both directions, how much the people and
organizations were transformed in the process, and how much inspiration for
future work, together, was co-conspired
- >  Although the goal of “doing good” or “helping” or
“democratizing” might be well-intentioned, that first act of imagining others in
a deficit position in relation to yourself repeats the cycle of domination and
oppression. Access to education and technology becomes a way to socialize
“those people” into a given social order, without challenging the very basis of the
order’s existence
- > technology might actually be used for collective benefit. They have never been
taught a vocabulary for seeing and addressing how gaps in power, privilege and
justice relate to technical and informatic fields
