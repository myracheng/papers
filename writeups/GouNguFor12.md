- genetic programming (GP) to find minimal repairs, a stochastic search method
- tested

## introduction / motivation
- *repair* : patch that causes passing test case
- GP approach:
    - find new program *variants*. evaluate using *fitness fn*
    - operates at statement lvl
    - using only statements from the program itself
    - *fault localization* localize operators on statements that are executed on the failing test case. MC: failing test cases = incorrect labels?

## aproach
- gp has population of program variants, represented as trees.
    - generated by mutations & crossovers
         - mutations done w/ probabilities according to weights. deletion, insertion (another statement is inserted), or swap
         - crossover: combine first part of a variant with second part with another
    - represented as pair (abstract syntax tree (AST), *weighted path* (list of prog statements w/ wieghts based on the statements occurrence in execution traces))
        - weighted path localizes fault
    - selection is done by stochastic universal sampling + tournament selection (small subsets + most fit member)

- fitness function: based on test cases

- search terminates when *primary repair* that passes all test cases
    - minimize this to create *final repair* by considering each difference and seeing whether any can be discarded using *delta debugging*

# mc: applications to pronear
- how to make program transformations based on a neural model? does it make sense to delete/swap/etc operations?
